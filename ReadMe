🧾 Project Title: LawLens – AI Legal Document Analyzer

🧠 About the Project
LawLens is a beginner-friendly AI-powered web app that helps simplify, analyze, and understand complex legal documents. Whether you're a lawyer, student, startup founder, or someone just trying to interpret a contract — LawLens acts like your virtual legal assistant.

It lets users upload legal files like PDFs, DOCX, or plain text, and then performs useful AI tasks such as summarization, Q&A, fake clause detection, and named entity recognition — all within a sleek, Streamlit-powered UI.

🚀 What It Can Do: 

✅ Summarize Legal Documents
Converts dense legal text into simplified summaries in seconds using an LLM.

❓ Ask Questions About the Document
Lets you ask custom questions about the uploaded legal file and provides intelligent, contextual answers.

🚨 Detect Suspicious or Fake Clauses
Uses LLM reasoning to flag vague, unusual, or risky clauses automatically.

📎 Document Metadata Viewer
Displays embedded metadata from uploaded PDF and DOCX files such as:

Author

Title

Creation & modification dates

Page count and producer (for PDFs)

🧠 Why it matters:
This metadata is crucial for verifying the origin, version history, and authorship of legal documents — especially in due diligence and legal audits.

🕵️‍♂️ Document Authenticity Checker
Analyzes internal file properties to assess if the document appears manipulated or suspicious. For PDFs, it checks embedded metadata; for DOCX files, it inspects the core properties.

🧠 Why it matters:
Fake or tampered documents are common in legal and compliance scenarios. This feature helps lawyers and legal teams validate document authenticity at a glance — without opening complex tools.

📄 Export Summary and Answers
Allows you to download the summary and Q&A results in .docx format for sharing or saving.
