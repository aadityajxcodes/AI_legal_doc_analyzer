🧾 Project Title: LawLens – AI Legal Document Analyzer

🧠 About the Project
LawLens is a beginner-friendly AI-powered web app that helps simplify, analyze, and understand complex legal documents. Whether you're a lawyer, student, startup founder, or someone just trying to interpret a contract — LawLens acts like your virtual legal assistant.

It lets users upload legal files like PDFs, DOCX, or plain text, and then performs useful AI tasks such as summarization, Q&A, fake clause detection, and named entity recognition — all within a sleek, Streamlit-powered UI.

🚀 What It Can Do
✅ Summarize Legal Documents
Converts dense legal text into simplified summaries in seconds using an LLM.

❓ Ask Questions About the Document
Lets you ask custom questions about the uploaded legal file and provides intelligent, contextual answers.

🚨 Detect Suspicious or Fake Clauses
Uses LLM reasoning to flag vague, unusual, or risky clauses automatically.

📌 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Extracts important people, places, laws, organizations, and dates from the document using spaCy.

📄 Export Summary and Answers
Allows you to download the summary and Q&A results in .docx format for sharing or saving.
